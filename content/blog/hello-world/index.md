This is my first blog post and mostly an experiment. It is mostly driven
by my curiosity to learn a little bit about a "modern" web development stack and "severless""
static websites. When you aren't a professional web developer it isn't easy to find your way around
the myriad web frameworks, stacks, hosting options etc. So, for no particular good (or bad) reason my descion
fell on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). So, here I am  documenting for you and for myself how to build this.


## Gatsby 

I am using [Kyle Mathews's](https://twitter.com/kylemathews) starter blog [template](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/). This 


a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a> and is based on the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/">Starter blog template</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/kylemathews">Kyle Mathews

This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
