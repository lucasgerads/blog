 title: Covid19 in Aachen (Stadt und Städteregion) 
 date: "2020-03-29T13:13:01.000Z" 
--- 
The city of Aachen publishes (more or less) daily updates about Covid19. It's in the form of a daily press release, so I decided to collect this data to make it more usable for further processing ([google spread sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Th4GSgmTpX4GtcebVDzIfRuCOu2cSOc2WJCORHcCw-Y))

Below is development of cases in the Städteregion Aachen and the city of Aachen
![Cases of Covid19](cases.png)and the current death toll
![Deaths from Covid19](deaths.png)and the year of birth of the deceased. Their average (median) year of birth was 1939. Which corresponds to an average age of 81.

## How this site is generated 
 This site is automatically generated when data is added to the spread sheet. You can find the corresponding python script inside my [github repository](https://github.com/lucasgerads/blog/blob/master/content/blog/Covid19/main.py).

I keep the data in a google [spread sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Th4GSgmTpX4GtcebVDzIfRuCOu2cSOc2WJCORHcCw-Y)
