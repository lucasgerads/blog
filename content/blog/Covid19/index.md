 title: Covid19 in Aachen (Stadt und Städteregion)

The city of Aachen publishes (more or less) daily updates about Covid19. It's in the form of a daily press release, so I decided to collect this data to make it more usable for further processing.

Below is development of cases in the Städteregion Aachen and the city of Aachen
![Cases of Covid19](cases.png)and the current death toll
![Deaths from Covid19](deaths.png)and the year of birth of the deceased. Their average (median) year of birth was 1939. Which corresponds to an average age of 81.

I keep the data in a google [spread sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Th4GSgmTpX4GtcebVDzIfRuCOu2cSOc2WJCORHcCw-Y)
