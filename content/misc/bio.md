# About me

I am interested in and write about, in descending order of expertise: technology, business, science, entrepreneurship, politics, and life. All opinions expressed on this blog are my own.

I run the company [Aixcon PowerSystems GmbH](https://aixcon.de) in Stolberg (Rhld.), Germany, spending my days building power electronics and automation for various applications such as welding, coating and material treatment. My lovely life partner Lydia helps me edit my posts.
